# celtic-knot-generator

This project is a fork of [Celtic Knot Genertor](https://w-shadow.com/celtic-knots/) written by by Janis Elsts in 2012-2018 
(Description: https://w-shadow.com/blog/2012/05/17/celtic-knot-generator-canvas/).

It replaces PNG output with SVG output (and HTML5 canvas with SVG) so that it can be used for CNC machining.

More features may be added in future (gradients, area restrictions).
